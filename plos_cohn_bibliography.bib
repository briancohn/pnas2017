@article{Kording2014130,
	Abstract = {Analyzing data from experiments involves variables that we neuroscientists are uncertain about. Efficiently calculating with such variables usually requires Bayesian statistics. As it is crucial when analyzing complex data, it seems natural that the brain would ``use'' such statistics to analyze data from the world. And indeed, recent studies in the areas of perception, action, and cognition suggest that Bayesian behavior is widespread, in many modalities and species. Consequently, many models have suggested that the brain is built on simple Bayesian principles. While the brain's code is probably not actually simple, I believe that Bayesian principles will facilitate the construction of faithful models of the brain. },

	To define a model using this system one specifies the surfaces of

	force-generating parameters of the muscles. Once a model is defined,
	the function of each muscle can be analyzed by computing its length,
	moment arms, force and joint moments. The software has been implemented
	on a computer graphics workstation so that users can view the model
	from any perspective and graphically manipulate the joint kinematics
	and musculoskeletal geometry. Models can also be animated to visualize
	the results of motion analysis experiments. Since the software can
	be used to study models of many different musculoskeletal structures,

@article{Valero-Cuevas2000Scaling,
	Abstract = {Human fingers have sufficiently more muscles than joints such that
	every fingertip force of submaximal magnitude can be produced by
	an infinite number of muscle coordination patterns. Nevertheless,
	the nervous system seems to effortlessly select muscle coordination
	patterns when sequentially producing fingertip forces of low, moderate,
	and maximal magnitude. The hypothesis of this study is that the selection
	of coordination patterns to produce submaximal forces is simplified
	by the appropriate modulation of the magnitude of a muscle coordination
	pattern capable of producing the largest expected fingertip force.
	In each of three directions, eight subjects were asked to sequentially
	produce fingertip forces of low, moderate, and maximal magnitude
	with their dominant forefinger. Muscle activity was described by
	fine-wire electromyograms (EMGs) simultaneously collected from all
	muscles of the forefinger. A muscle coordination pattern was defined
	as the vector list of the EMG activity of each muscle. For all force
	directions, statistically significant muscle coordination patterns
	similar to those previously reported for 100\% of maximal fingertip
	forces were found for 50\% of maximal voluntary force. Furthermore
	the coordination pattern and fingertip force vector magnitudes were
	highly correlated (r > 0.88). Average coordination pattern vectors
	at 50 and 100\% of maximal force were highly correlated with each
	other, as well as with individual coordination pattern vectors in
	the ramp transitions preceding them. In contrast to this consistency
	of EMG coordination patterns, predictions using a musculoskeletal
	computer model of the forefinger show that force magnitudes =50\%
	of maximal fingertip force can be produced by coordination patterns
	drastically different from those needed for maximal force. Thus when
	modulating fingertip force magnitude across the voluntary range,
	the number of contributing muscles and the relative activity among
	them was not changed. Rather, the production of low and moderate
	forces seems to be simplified by appropriately scaling the magnitude
	of a coordination pattern capable of producing the highest force
	expected.},

	Abstract = {The observation that the activity of multiple muscles can be well approximated by a few linear synergies is viewed by some as a sign that such low-dimensional modules constitute a key component of the neural control system. Here, we argue that the usefulness of muscle synergies as a control principle should be evaluated in terms of errors produced not only in muscle space, but also in task space. We used data from a force-aiming task in two dimensions at the wrist, using an electromyograms (EMG)-driven virtual biomechanics technique that overcomes typical errors in predicting force from recorded EMG, to illustrate through simulation how synergy decomposition inevitably introduces substantial task space errors. Then, we computed the optimal pattern of muscle activation that minimizes summed-squared muscle activities, and demonstrated that synergy decomposition produced similar results on real and simulated data. We further assessed the influence of synergy decomposition on aiming errors (AEs) in a more redundant system, using the optimal muscle pattern computed for the elbow-joint complex (i.e., 13 muscles acting in two dimensions). Because EMG records are typically not available from all contributing muscles, we also explored reconstructions from incomplete sets of muscles. The redundancy of a given set of muscles had opposite effects on the goodness of muscle reconstruction and on task achievement; higher redundancy is associated with better EMG approximation (lower residuals), but with higher AEs. Finally, we showed that the number of synergies required to approximate the optimal muscle pattern for an arbitrary biomechanical system increases with task-space dimensionality, which indicates that the capacity of synergy decomposition to explain behavior depends critically on the scope of the original database. These results have implications regarding the viability of muscle synergy as a putative neural control mechanism, and also as a control algorithm to restore movements.

	Abstract = {We provide an overview of optimal control methods to nonlinear neuromuscular systems and discuss their limitations. Moreover we extend current optimal control methods to their application to neuromuscular models with realistically numerous musculotendons; as most prior work is limited to torque-driven systems. Recent work on computational motor control has explored the used of control theory and estimation as a conceptual tool to understand the underlying computational principles of neuromuscular systems. After all, successful biological systems regularly meet conditions for stability, robustness and performance for multiple classes of complex tasks. Among a variety of proposed control theory frameworks to explain this, stochastic optimal control has become a dominant framework to the point of being a standard computational technique to reproduce kinematic trajectories of reaching movements (see) In particular, we demonstrate the application of optimal control to a neuromuscular model of the index finger with all seven musculotendons producing a tapping task. Our simulations include 1) a muscle model that includes force- length and force-velocity characteristics; 2) an anatomically plausible biomechanical model of the index finger that includes a tendinous network for the extensor mechanism and 3) a contact model that is based on a nonlinear spring-damper attached at the end effector of the index finger. We demonstrate that it is feasible to apply optimal control to systems with realistically large state vectors and conclude that, while optimal control is an adequate formalism to create computational models of neuro-musculoskeletal systems, there remain important challenges and limitations that need to be considered and overcome such as contact transitions, curse of dimensionality, and constraints on states and controls.},

@article{Kuo1993Human,
	Abstract = {We developed a theoretical framework for studying coordination strategies
	in standing posture. The framework consists of a musculoskeletal
	model of the human lower extremity in the sagittal plane and a technique
	to visualize, geometrically, how constraints internal and external
	to the body affect movement. The set of all feasible accelerations
	(i.e., the "feasible acceleration set" or FAS) that muscles can induce
	at positions near upright were calculated. We found that musculoskeletal
	mechanics dictate that independent control of joints is relatively
	difficult to achieve. When muscle activations are constrained so
	the knees stay straight, to approximate the typical postural response
	to perturbation, the corresponding subset of the feasible acceleration
	set greatly favors a combination of ankle and hip movement in the
	ratio 1:3 (called the "hip strategy"). Independent control of these
	two joints remains difficult to achieve. When near the boundary of
	instability, the orientation and shape of this subset show that the
	movement strategy necessary to maintain stability, without taking
	a step, is quite restricted. Hypothesizing that regulation of center-of-mass
	position is crucial to maintaining balance, we examined the feasible
	set of center-of-mass accelerations. When the knees must be kept
	straight, the acceleration of the center of mass is severely limited
	vertically, but not horizontally. We also found that the "ankle strategy",
	involving rotation about the ankles only, requires more muscle activation
	than the "hip strategy" for a given amount of horizontal acceleration.
	Our model therefore predicts that the hip strategy is most effective
	at controlling the center of mass with minimal muscle activation
	("neural effort").},

@article{deRugy2012habitual,
	Abstract = {When sharing load among multiple muscles, humans appear to select an optimal pattern of activation that minimizes costs such as the effort or variability of movement. How the nervous system achieves this behavior, however, is unknown. Here we show that contrary to predictions from optimal control theory, habitual muscle activation patterns are surprisingly robust to changes in limb biomechanics. We first developed a method to simulate joint forces in real time from electromyographic recordings of the wrist muscles. When the model was altered to simulate the effects of paralyzing a muscle, the subjects simply increased the recruitment of all muscles to accomplish the task, rather than recruiting only the useful muscles. When the model was altered to make the force output of one muscle unusually noisy, the subjects again persisted in recruiting all muscles rather than eliminating the noisy one. Such habitual coordination patterns were also unaffected by real modifications of biomechanics produced by selectively damaging a muscle without affecting sensory feedback. Subjects naturally use different patterns of muscle contraction to produce the same forces in different pronation--supination postures, but when the simulation was based on a posture different from the actual posture, the recruitment patterns tended to agree with the actual rather than the simulated posture. The results appear inconsistent with computation of motor programs by an optimal controller in the brain. Rather, the brain may learn and recall command programs that result in muscle coordination patterns generated by lower sensorimotor circuitry that are functionally ``good-enough.''

@article{Bartel1986effect,
	Abstract = {Debris resulting from damage to the surface of polyethylene components
	of total joint replacements has previously been shown to contribute
	to long-term problems such as loosening and infection. Surface damage
	has been associated with fatigue processes due to stresses arising
	from contact between the metal and polyethylene components in these
	prostheses. In the present study, we used elasticity and finite-element
	solutions to determine these stresses for total hip replacements
	with head diameters of twenty-two and twenty-eight millimeters and
	for a condylar total knee replacement. We also examined the effect
	on these stresses of using carbon-fiber-reinforced polyethylene instead
	of plain polyethylene. Stresses associated with surface damage in
	the tibial component of the total knee replacement were much larger
	than those in the hip replacements. The analysis of contact stress
	as a function of thickness of the polyethylene insert for tibial
	components showed that a thickness of more than eight to ten millimeters
	should be maintained when possible. The contact stress in the tibial
	components was reduced most when the articulating surfaces were more
	conforming in the medial-lateral direction. Contact stresses were
	much less sensitive to changes in geometry in the anterior-posterior
	direction. For the hip components, the stresses were lower in the
	acetabular component of the twenty-eight-millimeter hip replacement
	than in the twenty-two-millimeter replacement. The use of carbon-fiber-reinforced
	polyethylene resulted in stresses that were higher by as much as
	40 per cent. Because the contact area between articulating surfaces
	moves during flexion, portions of the surface will be subjected to
	cyclic stresses. The contact area for the knee replacements in flexion
	was smaller than for the hip replacements, and the range of the maximum
	principal stress was larger. Consequently, the combination of the
	higher stress and the moving contact area is more likely to cause
	surface damage due to fatigue in tibial components than in acetabular
	components, which is consistent with clinical observations.},

abstract={The analysis of neural dynamics in several brain cortices has consistently uncovered low-dimensional manifolds that capture a significant fraction of neural variability. These neural manifolds are spanned by specific patterns of correlated neural activity, the ?neural modes.? We discuss a model for neural control of movement in which the time-dependent activation of these neural modes is the generator of motor behavior. This manifold-based view of motor cortex may lead to a better understanding of how the brain controls movement.},

	and convenient environment for the design and evaluation of controllers
	for functional electrical stimulation (FES) prior to clinical trials.
	We have developed a set of integrated musculoskeletal modeling tools
	to facilitate the model building process. Simulink models of musculoskeletal
	systems are created using two software packages developed in our
	laboratory, Musculoskeletal Modeling in Simulink (MMS) and virtual
	muscle, in addition to one software package available commercially,
	SIMM (Musculographics Inc., USA). MMS converts anatomically accurate
	musculoskeletal models generated by SIMM into Simulink(R) blocks.
	It also removes run-time constraints on kinetic simulations in SIMM,
	and allows the development of complex musculoskeletal models without
	writing a line of code. Virtual muscle builds realistic Simulink
	models of muscles responding to either natural recruitment or FES.
	Models of sensorimotor control systems can be developed using various
	Matlab (Mathworks Inc., USA) toolboxes and integrated easily with
	these musculoskeletal blocks in the graphical environment of Simulink.},

@article{Inouye2013HumanHand,
	Abstract = {How functional versatility emerges in vertebrate limbs in spite of
	their anatomical complexity is a longstanding question. In particular,
	fingers are actuated by numerous muscles pulling on tendons following
	intricate paths. In contrast, the tendon-driven robotic hands with
	intuitive tendon routings preferred by roboticists for their ease
	of analysis and control do not perform at the level of their biological
	counterparts. Thus there is much debate on whether and how the anatomy
	of the human hand contributes to grasp capabilities. These parallel
	questions in biology and robotics arise partly because it is unclear
	how the number and routing of tendons offer functional benefits.
	We use a novel computational approach that analyzes tendon-driven
	systems and quantifies grasp quality to compare the precision grasp
	capabilities of thousands of robotic index finger and thumb designs
	vs. the capabilities measured in human hands. Our exhaustive search
	finds that neither the symmetrical designs sometimes preferred by
	roboticists nor randomly generated designs approach the grasp capabilities
	of the human hand (they are on average 73% weaker). However, optimizing
	for anatomically plausible asymmetry in joint centers, tendon routings,
	and maximal tendon tensions produces designs that can exceed the
	human hand by 13--45%, and outperform the preferred robotic designs
	by up to 435%. Thus, the grasp capabilities of prosthetic or anthropomorphic
	hands can be greatly improved by judiciously altering design parameters,
	at times in counter-intuitive ways. Moreover we conclude that, in
	addition to its other capabilities, the human hand's anatomy is very
	advantageous for precision grasp as it greatly outperforms numerous
	alternative robotic designs.},

@article{Pandy1990optimal,
	Abstract = {To understand how intermuscular control, inertial interactions among
	body segments, and musculotendon dynamics coordinate human movement,
	we have chosen to study maximum-height jumping. Because this activity
	presents a relatively unambiguous performance criterion, it fits
	well into the framework of optimal control theory. The human body
	is modeled as a four-segment, planar, articulated linkage, with adjacent
	links joined together by frictionless revolutes. Driving the skeletal
	system are eight musculotendon actuators, each muscle modeled as
	a three-element, lumped-parameter entity, in series with tendon.
	Tendon is assumed to be elastic, and its properties are defined by
	a stress-strain curve. The mechanical behavior of muscle is described
	by a Hill-type contractile element, including both series and parallel
	elasticity. Driving the musculotendon model is a first-order representation
	of excitation-contraction (activation) dynamics. The optimal control
	problem is to maximize the height reached by the center of mass of
	the body subject to body-segmental, musculotendon, and activation
	dynamics, a zero vertical ground reaction force at lift-off, and
	constraints which limit the magnitude of the incoming neural control
	signals to lie between zero (no excitation) and one (full excitation).
	A computational solution to this problem was found on the basis of
	a Mayne-Polak dynamic optimization algorithm. Qualitative comparisons
	between the predictions of the model and previously reported experimental
	findings indicate that the model reproduces the major features of
	a maximum-height squat jump (i.e. limb-segmental angular displacements,
	vertical and horizontal ground reaction forces, sequence of muscular
	activity, overall jump height, and final lift-off time).},

@article{Prilutsky2000Muscle,
	Abstract = {In this response, the major criticisms of the target article are addressed.
	Terminology from the target article that may have caused some confusion
	is clarified. In particular, the tasks that have the basic features
	of muscle coordination, as identified in the target article, have
	been limited in scope. A new metabolic optimization criterion suggested
	by Alexander (2000) is examined for its ability to predict muscle
	coordination in walking. Issues concerning the validation of muscle
	force predictions, the rules of muscle coordination, and the role
	of directional constraints in coordination of two-joint muscles are
	discussed. It is shown in particular that even in one-joint systems,
	the forces predicted by the criterion of Crowninshield and Brand
	(1981) depend upon the muscle moment arms and the physiological cross-sectional
	areas in much more complex ways than either previously assumed in
	the target article, or incorrectly derived by Herzog and Ait-Haddou
	(2000). It is concluded that the criterion of Crowninshield and Brand
	qualitatively predicts the basic coordination features of the major
	one- and two-joint muscles in a number of highly skilled, repetitive
	motor tasks performed by humans under predictable conditions and
	little demands on stability and accuracy. A possible functional significance
	of such muscle coordination may be the minimization of perceived
	effort, muscle fatigue, and/or energy expenditure.},

@article{Rawlinson2002Flat,
	Abstract = {The potential for wear in UHMWPE components for total knee replacements
	can be reduced by decreasing the stresses and strains arising from
	tibial-femoral contact. The conformity of the articular surfaces
	has a large effect on the resultant stresses, and components that
	achieve flat medial-lateral contact have been assumed to produce
	the lowest stresses due to their perfect conformity. We computed
	the stresses arising from curved and flat contact on a half-space
	using two-dimensional, plane strain elasticity solutions and finite
	element analyses to compare the performance of curved and flat indenters.
	These indenters were represented by a polynomial so the profiles
	could be continuously varied from curved to flat. Curved contact
	resulted in maximum stresses at the center of contact, while flat
	contact produced maximum stresses at the edge of contact. In addition,
	three contemporary tibial configurations (flat-on-flat, curved-on-flat,
	and curved-on-curved geometries) were analyzed using the finite element
	method with nonlinear material properties. The maximum contact stress,
	von Mises stress, and von Mises strain were lowest for the curved-on-curved
	model. The other configurations resulted in higher contact stresses,
	von Mises stresses, and von Mises strains. The perfect conformity
	arising from flat contact did not reduce the contact stresses in
	the UHMWPE component. The tensile stresses, however, were lowest
	for the flat-on-flat geometry compared with the other two configurations.
	Relating these distinct differences could prove useful in interpretation
	of data from simulator and retrieval studies.},

@article{Valero-Cuevas2000,
	Abstract = {Human fingers have sufficiently more muscles than joints such that
	every fingertip force of submaximal magnitude can be produced by
	an infinite number of muscle coordination patterns. Nevertheless,
	the nervous system seems to effortlessly select muscle coordination
	patterns when sequentially producing fingertip forces of low, moderate,
	and maximal magnitude. The hypothesis of this study is that the selection
	of coordination patterns to produce submaximal forces is simplified
	by the appropriate modulation of the magnitude of a muscle coordination
	pattern capable of producing the largest expected fingertip force.
	In each of three directions, eight subjects were asked to sequentially
	produce fingertip forces of low, moderate, and maximal magnitude
	with their dominant forefinger. Muscle activity was described by
	fine-wire electromyograms (EMGs) simultaneously collected from all
	muscles of the forefinger. A muscle coordination pattern was defined
	as the vector list of the EMG activity of each muscle. For all force
	directions, statistically significant muscle coordination patterns
	similar to those previously reported for 100\% of maximal fingertip
	forces were found for 50\% of maximal voluntary force. Furthermore
	the coordination pattern and fingertip force vector magnitudes were
	highly correlated (r > 0.88). Average coordination pattern vectors
	at 50 and 100\% of maximal force were highly correlated with each
	other, as well as with individual coordination pattern vectors in
	the ramp transitions preceding them. In contrast to this consistency
	of EMG coordination patterns, predictions using a musculoskeletal
	computer model of the forefinger show that force magnitudes =50\%
	of maximal fingertip force can be produced by coordination patterns
	drastically different from those needed for maximal force. Thus when
	modulating fingertip force magnitude across the voluntary range,
	the number of contributing muscles and the relative activity among
	them was not changed. Rather, the production of low and moderate
	forces seems to be simplified by appropriately scaling the magnitude
	of a coordination pattern capable of producing the highest force
	expected.},

	Abstract = {Nonlinear dynamical systems have been used in many disciplines to model complex behaviors, including biological motor control, robotics, perception, economics, traffic prediction, and neuroscience. While often the unexpected emergent behavior of nonlinear systems is the focus of investigations, it is of equal importance to create goal-directed behavior (e.g., stable locomotion from a system of coupled oscillators under perceptual guidance). Modeling goal-directed behavior with nonlinear systems is, however, rather difficult due to the parameter sensitivity of these systems, their complex phase transitions in response to subtle parameter changes, and the difficulty of analyzing and predicting their long-term behavior; intuition and time-consuming parameter tuning play a major role. This letter presents and reviews dynamical movement primitives, a line of research for modeling attractor behaviors of autonomous nonlinear dynamical systems with the help of statistical learning techniques. The essence of our approach is to start with a simple dynamical system, such as a set of linear differential equations, and transform those into a weakly nonlinear system with prescribed attractor dynamics by means of a learnable autonomous forcing term. Both point attractors and limit cycle attractors of almost arbitrary complexity can be generated. We explain the design principle of our approach and evaluate its properties in several example applications in motor control and robotics.},

@article{chhabra2008learning,
	Abstract = {The computational complexities arising in motor control can be ameliorated through the use of a library of motor synergies. We present a new model, referred to as the Greedy Additive Regression (GAR) model, for learning a library of torque sequences, and for learning the coefficients of a linear combination of sequences minimizing a cost function. From the perspective of numerical optimization, the GAR model is interesting because it creates a library of "local features"---each sequence in the library is a solution to a single training task---and learns to combine these sequences using a local optimization procedure, namely, additive regression. We speculate that learners with local representational primitives and local optimization procedures will show good performance on nonlinear tasks. The GAR model is also interesting from the perspective of motor control because it outperforms several competing models. Results using a simulated two-joint arm suggest that the GAR model consistently shows excellent performance in the sense that it rapidly learns to perform novel, complex motor tasks. Moreover, its library is overcomplete and sparse, meaning that only a small fraction of the stored torque sequences are used when learning a new movement. The library is also robust in the sense that, after an initial training period, nearly all novel movements can be learned as additive combinations of sequences in the library, and in the sense that it shows good generalization when an arm's dynamics are altered between training and test conditions, such as when a payload is added to the arm. Lastly, the GAR model works well regardless of whether motor tasks are specified in joint space or Cartesian space. We conclude that learning techniques using local primitives and optimization procedures are viable and potentially important methods for motor control and possibly other domains, and that these techniques deserve further examination by the artificial intelligence and cognitive science communities.},

@inproceedings{todorov2009compositionality,
	Abstract = {We present a theory of compositionality in stochastic optimal control, showing how task-optimal controllers can be constructed from certain primitives. The primitives are themselves feedback controllers pursuing their own agendas. They are mixed in proportion to how much progress they are making towards their agendas and how compatible their agendas are with the present task. The resulting composite control law is provably optimal when the problem belongs to a certain class. This class is rather general and yet has a number of unique properties - one of which is that the Bellman equation can be made linear even for non-linear or discrete dynamics. This gives rise to the compositionality developed here. In the special case of linear dynamics and Gaussian noise our framework yields analytical solutions (i.e. non-linear mixtures of linear-quadratic regulators) without requiring the final cost to be quadratic. More generally, a natural set of control primitives can be constructed by applying SVD to Greens function of the Bellman equation. We illustrate the theory in the context of human arm movements. The ideas of optimality and compositionality are both very prominent in the field of motor control, yet they are hard to reconcile. Our work makes this possible.},

	Abstract = {Abstract
Muscle synergies have been proposed as a way for the central nervous system (CNS) to simplify the generation of motor commands and they have been shown to explain a large fraction of the variation in the muscle patterns across a variety of conditions. However, whether human subjects are able to control forces and movements effectively with a small set of synergies has not been tested directly. Here we show that muscle synergies can be used to generate target forces in multiple directions with the same accuracy achieved using individual muscles. We recorded electromyographic (EMG) activity from 13 arm muscles and isometric hand forces during a force reaching task in a virtual environment. From these data we estimated the force associated to each muscle by linear regression and we identified muscle synergies by non-negative matrix factorization. We compared trajectories of a virtual mass displaced by the force estimated using the entire set of recorded EMGs to trajectories obtained using 4-5 muscle synergies. While trajectories were similar, when feedback was provided according to force estimated from recorded EMGs (EMG-control) on average trajectories generated with the synergies were less accurate. However, when feedback was provided according to recorded force (force-control) we did not find significant differences in initial angle error and endpoint error. We then tested whether synergies could be used as effectively as individual muscles to control cursor movement in the force reaching task by providing feedback according to force estimated from the projection of the recorded EMGs into synergy space (synergy-control). Human subjects were able to perform the task immediately after switching from force-control to EMG-control and synergy-control and we found no differences between initial movement direction errors and endpoint errors in all control modes. These results indicate that muscle synergies provide an effective strategy for motor coordination.},
